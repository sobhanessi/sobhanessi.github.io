        description: `I born and raise in a very high political family so there is no
    question why I'm political activist and seeking freedom for my
    beloved country.
    <br />
    However I'm not nationalist, I just want to have democracy in my
    country which if we have it in Iran, there would be no doubt that
    all the countries around Iran can rise and therefore we will have
    democracy and less fundamentalists and jihadists in the middle-east.
    <br />
    I'm not writing this for just people to come every time and see who
    I am, but I'm just writing this for future references.
    <br />
    But let's get back to my childhood.
    <br />
    As I mentioned above, all my families and relatives are political
    activists either in the regime side or against the Mullah's regime
    of Iran. I remember my first impression of demonstrations which
    happened in 1997 in July which my city, Tehran, was completely
    locked down and too many people and especially students killed by
    regime. I was not in the age to digest everything that is happening,
    but I was seeing poeple are dying and getting shot by Basijis and
    Sepahis. Something like a lamp was turned on my mind which I was
    always asking that what is going on. but the most important thing
    here is that, on that time due to suppression of regime, we were not
    allowed to speak in the public or even in the school I couldn't able
    to share my feelings and thoughts because then we would be arrested
    and we could be isolated from the society and be put in the Evin
    prison, therefore, I didn't have any kind of friends to share all of
    these things and they couldn't really understand what and how do I
    feel.
    <br />
    But beside all of these political things, my first moment of working
    with computers happened at the age of 3 or 4. My uncle had a
    computer company on that time and he had some computers which was
    running by MS-DOS on that time and the computers had Floppy Disks
    and we had to command them by the shell to do what and that was
    amazing to me and I always wanted to learn about computers and be
    master on that. I need to mention here that I have some problems
    with my eyes, it is called Strabismus and I had done 3 times of hard
    surgery which were very difficult for me and due to this issue I had
    to close my right eye in order to strengthen my left eye. I remember
    I did it for 4 to 5 years. Because of this problem, my family was
    always against me to work with computers so you guess what happened!

        description: `From the age of 7 until 12 was a bit steady and nothing
    especiall happened actually. The only thing that happened which
    changed my life was going to Iraq to the Camp Ashraf when I was
    only 10 to see our relatives there which tragedies happened
    afterwards.
    <br />I actually need to shed light that two of my uncles and
    ony of my aunts ( all from my father's side ) had been killed or
    terrored by the regime of Iran. My father also was a prisoner
    before 2006 for more than 10 years in both regimes of Shah and
    after the 1979's revolution. My mother was also imprisoned when
    she was only 12! My grandmother and grandfather and also my
    uncles and aunts have served some amount of years in the prison
    in Tehran and being tortured by the regime's authorities,
    especially my father!
    <br />
    After we came back from camp of Ashraf, just a year after,
    regime of Iran arrested my father and put him to the prison and
    they sentenced him to 5 years in the prision but not in Tehran,
    they exiled him to another city, Karaj, in the prison of
    Gohardasht which is one of the most terrible ones in Iran.{" "}
    <br />
    Anyways, that was one of the first incidents that I was feeling
    fascism with my blood! I was completely seeing it with my eyes!
    going through the prison to meet my father for 10 to 15 minutes
    every week and don't have any kind of chance to call him. That
    was terrible.
    <br />I really didn't have anybody on my side except my brother
    and my mother and for sure my grandmother. I was not able to
    talk to anybody about what it is going because people could
    abandon us and leave us behind.

    which at the begining I didn't know what have I done so far but
    I'm going to explain that what happened.
    <br />
    The demonstrations of 2009 against regime.
    <br />I was only 15, which after the election happened and that
    was the moment I could feel that I belong to some group of
    people and I realy wanted to participate on those
    demonstrations. In the city of Tehran, everything and everywhere
    was completely out of control of the regime until Mir Hossein
    came and put the water on the fire. We could really defeat the
    regime because the amount of people who were participating was
    so enough to completely take over the government and make
    democracy however didn't happen anyway!
    <br />I remember I was only 15 I was going to demonstrations
    with my grandmother despite the fact that my family didn't want
    me to participate.
    <br />
    The tragedy happened again that my father was called by the
    regime to come back to the prison because of the chaotic
    situation of the country which last for about a year. In the
    school as I mentioned that I didn't know that I have stepped on
    where, I again was isolated because the school was completely
    rulled by fascist group called the Hezb-e Motalefe Isalmi.
    Everything they were saying was totally against my ideas but I
    had no choice rather than bearing them and not to talk to
    anybody.
    <br />
    My father was in prison, I had no friends. I was completely
    isolated.
    <br />
    On that time I tried to learn some programming things but there
    was one main problem which was the internet which I had no
    access to it and again I opt out of it.
    <br /> This loop was going on until I graduated from high school
    and I admitted for university but this time due to pressure of
    my family I chose the survey engineering instead of computer
    which I wanted to go for it.`,

        description: `In the university, at the begining everything was going good but
    again after my friends realized that I political acitivist all
    of them abandon me and left me behind.
    <br />
    There was an incident that came to my mind which I realized that
    I'm wasting my time, that was then I decided to change my
    studies from survey engineering to computer engineering.
    <br />I was learning so fast. I was enjoying my studies but
    something terrible happened again. This time to me.
    <br />
    It was in the December of 2017 and January of 2018 that there
    was so many intense demonstrations against the regime which too
    many were killed by the regime or being arrested. Although I was
    not arrested in the middle of demonstrations but I remember it
    was a snowy night in February of 2018 that I was arrested by the
    agents of ministry of information and not just me, they have
    even arrested my mother which she has so many problems with her
    heart. They have beaten me and they put gun on my leg ( they
    didn't shoot however ) but they punched me and bullied me and
    they brought us to the prison of Evin ( 209 ). I didn't what
    should I do and will be alive there or not!
    <br />
    After being one month in the prison, they have released me for a
    certain amount of time until my trial come up. During the court
    session, the judge's name was Mohammad Mir Moghise who is really
    famous of his actions against political activists that have
    sentenced them to execution especially in 1988 massacare and he
    was also my father's judge during that time, he was completely
    insulting me and telling me bullshit. That was then I decided to
    really think of leaving Iran and saving my life because the
    judge during the trial told that we are gonna kill you in the
    prison and we will never let you breathe.
    <br />
    Just a week after they sentenced to the 7 years of being in
    prison and like my father they have exiled to a very worst place
    out of Tehran.
    <br />
    From Iran to Greece, I had a very tough journey which I had to
    flee all the borders illegally with other migrants.
    <br />
    Too many things happened to me in Greece, such as living with a
    smuggler for two years and waiting for my asylum interview for
    more than 3 years! Not able to find a suitable job and couldn't
    continue my education in Greece. All of them together has made
    me a very strong person that will not bend easily during hard
    and tough situations. I made out of my time in Greece and I
    learnt so many things despite the all traumas I have been
    having.
    <br />
    The story of me is not finished. But here I just mentioned the
    very notable ones that have impacted me so much.`,
