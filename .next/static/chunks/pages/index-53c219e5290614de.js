I remember my first impression of demonstrations which\n    happened in 1997 in July which my city, Tehran, was completely\n    locked down and too many people and especially students killed by\n    regime. I was not in the age to digest everything that is happening,\n    but I was seeing poeple are dying and getting shot by Basijis and\n    Sepahis. Something like a lamp was turned on my mind which I was\n    always asking that what is going on. but the most important thing\n    here is that, on that time due to suppression of regime, we were not\n    allowed to speak in the public or even in the school I couldn't able\n    to share my feelings and thoughts because then we would be arrested\n    and we could be isolated from the society and be put in the Evin\n    prison, therefore, I didn't have any kind of friends to share all of\n    these things and they couldn't really understand what and how do I\n    feel.\n    <br />\n    But beside all of these political things, my first moment of working\n    with computers happened at the age of 3 or 4. My uncle had a\n    computer company on that time and he had some computers which was\n    running by MS-DOS on that time and the computers had Floppy Disks\n    and we had to command them by the shell to do what and that was\n    amazing to me and I always wanted to learn about computers and be\n    master on that. I need to mention here that I have some problems\n    with my eyes, it is called Strabismus and I had done 3 times of hard\n    surgery which were very difficult for me and due to this issue I had\n    to close my right eye in order to strengthen my left eye. I remember\n    I did it for 4 to 5 years.

My father also was a prisoner\n    before 2006 for more than 10 years in both regimes of Shah and\n    after the 1979's revolution. My mother was also imprisoned when\n    she was only 12!
