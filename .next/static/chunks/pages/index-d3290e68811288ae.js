However I'm not nationalist, I just want to have democracy in my country which if we have it in Iran, there would be no doubt that all the countries around Iran can rise and therefore we will have democracy and less fundamentalists and jihadists in the middle-east.\n    I'm not writing this for just people to come every time and see who I am, but I'm just writing this for future references.\n    But let's get back to my childhood. \n    As I mentioned above, all my families and relatives are political activists either in the regime side or against the Mullah's regime of Iran. I remember my first impression of demonstrations which happened in 1997 in July which my city, Tehran, was completely locked down and too many people and especially students killed by regime. I was not in the age to digest everything that is happening, but I was seeing poeple are dying and getting shot by Basijis and Sepahis. Something like a lamp was turned on my mind which I was always asking that what is going on. but the most important thing here is that, on that time due to suppression of regime, we were not allowed to speak in the public or even in the school I couldn't able to share my feelings and thoughts because then we would be arrested and we could be isolated from the society and be put in the Evin prison, therefore, I didn't have any kind of friends to share all of these things and they couldn't really understand what and how do I feel.\n    But beside all of these political things, my first moment of working with computers appened at the age of 3 or 4. My uncle had a computer company on that time and he had some computers which was running by MS-DOS on that time and the computers had Floppy Disks and we had to command them by the shell to do what and that was amazing to me and I always wanted to learn about computers and be master on that. I need to mention here that I have some problems with my eyes, it is called Strabismus and I had done 3 times of hard surgery which were very difficult for me and due to this issue I had to close my right eye in order to strengthen my left eye. I remember I did it for 4 to 5 years. Because of this problem, my family was always against me to work with computers so you guess what happened!\n    ;)",color:s[300],title:"the beginning",titleStyle:{}},{left:!0,description:"From the age of 7 until 12 was a bit steady and nothing especiall happened actually. The only thing that happened which\n    changed my life was going to Iraq to the Camp Ashraf when I was only 10 to see our relatives there which tragedies happened afterwards.\n    I actually need to shed light that two of my uncles and ony of my aunts ( all from my father's side ) had been killed or terrored by the regime of Iran. My father also was a prisoner before 2006 for more than 10 years in both regimes of Shah and after the 1979's revolution. My mother was also imprisoned when she was only 12! My grandmother and grandfather and also my uncles and aunts have served some amount of years in the prison in Tehran and being tortured by the regime's authorities, especially my father!\n    After we came back from camp of Ashraf, just a year after, regime of Iran arrested my father and put him to the prison and they sentenced him to 5 years in the prision but not in Tehran, they exiled him to another city, Karaj, in the prison of Gohardasht which is one of the most terrible ones in Iran.\n    Anyways, that was one of the first incidents that I was feeling fascism with my blood! I was completely seeing it with my eyes!\n    going through the prison to meet my father for 10 to 15 minutes every week and don't have any kind of chance to call him. That was terrible.\n    I really didn't have anybody on my side except my brother and my mother and for sure my grandmother.

In the city of Tehran, everything and everywhere was completely out of control of the regime until Mir Hossein came and put the water on the fire. We could really defeat the regime because the amount of people who were participating was so enough to completely take over the government and make democracy however didn't happen anyway!\n    I remember I was only 15 I was going to demonstrations with my grandmother despite the fact that my family didn't want me to participate.\n    The tragedy happened again that my father was called by the regime to come back to the prison because of the chaotic situation of the country which last for about a year. In the school as I mentioned that I didn't know that I have stepped on where, I again was isolated because the school was completely rulled by fascist group called the Hezb-e Motalefe Isalmi. Everything they were saying was totally against my ideas but I had no choice rather than bearing them and not to talk to anybody.\n    My father was in prison, I had no friends. I was completely isolated.\n    On that time I tried to learn some programming things but there was one main problem which was the internet which I had no access to it and again I opt out of it.\n    This loop was going on until I graduated from high school and I admitted for university but this time due to pressure of my family I chose the survey engineering instead of computer which I wanted to go for it.",color:c.Z[200],title:"from 15 to 19",titleStyle:{}},{left:!0,description:"In the university, at the begining everything was going good but again after my friends realized that I political acitivist all of them abandon me and left me behind.\n    There was an incident that came to my mind which I realized that I'm wasting my time, that was then I decided to change my studies from survey engineering to computer engineering.\n    I was learning so fast. I was enjoying my studies but something terrible happened again. This time to me.\n    It was in the December of 2017 and January of 2018 that there was so many intense demonstrations against the regime which too many were killed by the regime or being arrested. Although I was not arrested in the middle of demonstrations but I remember it was a snowy night in February of 2018 that I was arrested by the agents of ministry of information and not just me, they have even arrested my mother which she has so many problems with her heart. They have beaten me and they put gun on my leg ( they didn't shoot however ) but they punched me and bullied me and they brought us to the prison of Evin ( 209 ). I didn't what should I do and will be alive there or not!\n    After being one month in the prison, they have released me for a certain amount of time until my trial come up. During the court\n    session, the judge's name was Mohammad Mir Moghise who is really famous of his actions against political activists that have sentenced them to execution especially in 1988 massacare and he was also my father's judge during that time, he was completely insulting me and telling me bullshit. That was then I decided to really think of leaving Iran and saving my life because the judge during the trial told that we are gonna kill you in the prison and we will never let you breathe.\n    Just a week after they sentenced to the 7 years of being in prison and like my father they have exiled to a very worst place out of Tehran.\n    From Iran to Greece, I had a very tough journey which I had to flee all the borders illegally with other migrants.\n    Too many things happened to me in Greece, such as living with a smuggler for two years and waiting for my asylum interview for more than 3 years! Not able to find a suitable job and couldn't continue my education in Greece. All of them together has made me a very strong person that will not bend easily during hard and tough situations.
