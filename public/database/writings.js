    text: `Why am I writing? Short answer, because I like it.<br/>
    However there are some lacks in writing skills and there is also language barrier here as well, 
    I might not be a good writer but I can publish some of the things that I have faced my entire life for other people who enjoys it.
    <br/>
    I hope these writings find you as well and you learn also something from me, or even me from you!`,
